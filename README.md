# The hello world and beyond Rust setup for NW

## Learning Path
Per KC:
Tools you get out of the box with rustc and rustup
things like their actor concurrency system in an easy to understand way -> https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Steve-Klabnik/dp/1593278284 and the offical rust book -> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

Oh and there is also an interactive learning repo similar to an Koans projects if you are familiar with those called rustlings https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/
